# PythonScriptFileMovement

## What's it do?
- Move files in the "download" directory to another sub-directory of your iCloud directory

## Why did I make this?
- I am constantly downloading tons of material and storing it in my iCloud drive (school stuff)

## How to Use:
- Run using Python 3.4 from the command line ("python moveDownloadFilesToIcloud.py")
- Takes an optional input for directory within iCloud to move files
 - i.e. arg = "College/Homework"

Note that the program will properly handle the beginning and ending "/" on your input
